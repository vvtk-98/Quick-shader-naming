# Quick-shader-naming
This Python script for Autodesk Maya automates the creation and assignment of Lambert shaders to objects or selected faces, following a consistent naming convention. It simplifies the process of material setup by:

    Auto-generating shader names based on object names (e.g., Head_geo â†’ Head_SHD and Head_SG)

    Supporting three workflows:

        Single object: Auto-names shaders based on geometry

        Multiple objects: Prompts for a base name and applies to all selected objects

        Selected faces: Assigns a new shader only to chosen faces

    Reduces repetitive tasks in material creation, ensuring clean and organized shading workflows

Ideal for modelers, lookdev artists, and technical artists who need to quickly set up placeholder materials or use materials for Geo Cache in Unreal Engine standardize naming conventions.
